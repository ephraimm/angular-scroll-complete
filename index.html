                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>angular-scroll-complete is a directive for AngularJS to evaluate an expression when the bottom of the directive's element approaches the bottom of the scroll bar on percent completion, which can be used to implement infinite scrolling</p>

                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p><strong>Bower</strong></p>
                <pre>
<code>bower install angular-scroll-complete </code>
</pre>
                <p>Ensure that your application module specifies angular-scroll-complete as a dependency:</p>
                <pre>
<code>angular.module('myApplication', ['angular-scroll-complete']); </code>
</pre>
                <p>Use the directive by specifying an when-scrolled attribute on an element.</p>
                <pre>
<code>when-scrolled="loadMore()" percent="70"</code>
</pre>
                <p>When scroll complete brodcast event to notify directive scroll is completed </p>
                <pre>
<code>$scope.$broadcast('scrollCompleted')</code>
</pre>
                <div class="overflow" when-scrolled="scrollComplete()" percent="{{percent}}">
